# 🎬 Project2: MovieHub

## 📝 Introduction

**MovieHub** is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application that allows users to browse, book, and manage movie showtimes. Users can sign up, log in, view available movies with details, and make bookings.

### Why I Built It

This project was built to demonstrate and apply core full-stack development skills including:

* RESTful routing
* CRUD operations
* Database relationships
* Dynamic views with EJS
* Authentication & session handling

It also served as a capstone for practicing Express, MongoDB, and user-centered interface design.
